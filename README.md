Title: Appointment Management System

Objective: I developed a software application as part of a school project using IntelliJ. The aim was to create an app that assists users in efficiently schedule, store, and track appointments and customer information. In addition, it offers the ability to generate various reports based on the data in the database.

Additional Report Description:

For the additional report, I have included a report that filters appointments by customer ID. This report comes in handy when you need to delete a customer and have to remove their appointments first. It provides a comprehensive list of all the appointments currently associated with the customer, making it easy to manage the customer database.
